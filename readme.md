# Kirby and the Crystal Crayon

Kirby and the Crystal Crayon is a drawing-based, platformer/physics game. Equipped with his trusty skateboard, Kirby will grind rails you draw for him, smashing into any winged Waddle Dees to get you points. Be careful though! If you crash into any scorching Waddle Doo seeking you out, you'll lose one of your three hearts. Draw slippery blue scribbles, slow time and really control Kirby with green scribbles, and bounce Kirby away with purple scribbles. Just make sure to also collect crystals so you don't run out of material. It's an infinite game, you can get high scores, but never really win.

TIP: Resizing the window to be bigger makes the game easier
